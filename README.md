## Submission for Steel Hacks 2018

## Inspiration

Monthly subscriptions pile up. Next thing you know, you notice you're down a hundred dollars. Since when did I ever sign up for Soundcloud Go?!

## What it does

1. Either by linking a bank account or uploading a bank statement, the app tracks reoccurring charges that users might not be aware of. 

2. Let's users manage their billing, set notifications for due payments, and easily see how much money they are spending a month on subscription services.

3. One-click cancellation coming soon...

4. Live data analysis of daily usage allows users to see what apps they are using the most and what apps they are using the least (and still paying for it).

## How we built it

node/express/jade stack with mongo

plaid api for banking interface

google vision api for OCR

android/room with sqlite

chart.js for the sweet visuals

### Note: Currently uses a sandbox environment API which has since expired. The bucket used for the demonstration has been deactivated as well.
